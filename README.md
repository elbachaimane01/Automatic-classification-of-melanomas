# Automatic-classification-of-melanomas
Skin cancer is one of most deadly diseases in humans. According to the high similarity between melanoma and nevus lesions, physicians take much more time to investigate these lesions. The automated classification of skin lesions will save effort, time and human life. Skin cancer is one of the most-deadly kinds of cancers . Essentially, melanoma and non-melanoma are the most known skin cancer types. Death rate and incidence have increased significantly in last years because of melanoma lesions. The rate of curing can reach over 90% where physicians would save patientsâ€™ life if these lesions were detected in early stage. Commonly, visual examination of skin cancer is difficult and may lead to wrong detection of lesions because there is a high similarity between different types of skin lesions (melanoma and non-melanoma). Therefore, the automatic classification of skin lesion images by using the image processing techniques and artificial intelligence is a successful alternative solution of the visual examination.

About 75% of deaths related to skin cancer come from Melanoma lesions. Survival rate of patients could be increased if melanoma was recognized accurately in its early stages. Manual detection of melanoma requires well-trained specialists to overcome variations of inter-observation. Thus, if the melanoma recognition has been done automatically, it will increase efficiency and accuracy of the early detection of this kind of cancer. The objective of this project is to propose a methodology for the automatic classification of skin lesions, based on image analysis and machine learning.

In the notebook file, we're going to extract feature following the ABCD rule then using several algorithms evaluate the classification methods
